                <p class="subtext">
                  Antarctica's vast, uninhabited expanses offer a level of
                  silence rarely found elsewhere on Earth. Away from the hum
                  of human activity, the primary sounds are natural ones – the
                  wind, the crackle of ice, and the distant calls of wildlife.

                  effect, providing a deep sense of peace and solitude. Many
                  visitors find the quietude of Antarctica to be a meditative
                  and transformative experience.

                  playful calls of seals add a fascinating soundtrack to the
                  Antarctic experience.

                  The cries of seabirds, such as penguins and albatrosses,
                  punctuate the silence. Each species has distinct calls, from
                  the squawks of Adélie penguins to the melodic songs of snowy
                  sheathbills.

                  The movement of ice is a constant in Antarctica. Listen for
                  the sharp crack of a glacier calving or the gentle fizz of
                  ice melting in the water, known as “bergy seltzer.”

                <p class="subtext">
                  The Antarctic wind, though often strong and biting, can also
                  produce a variety of sounds. From the howling gales of a
                  storm to the gentle rustle of snowflakes, the weather
                  contributes to the auditory experience.
