          Antarctica experiences extreme weather conditions with average summer temperatures ranging from -2°C to 8°C.
          Winter can be much harsher. Daylight varies dramatically, with continuous daylight in summer and near-total
          darkness in winter. The best time to visit is during the Antarctic summer (November to March), ideal for
          wildlife sightings and milder weather.

        <h2 class="title">Transportation Options</h2>
        <p class="subtext">
          Travel to Antarctica is primarily via cruise ships or expedition vessels, departing from ports in South
          America, Australia, or New Zealand. These ships are equipped to navigate icy waters safely. Consider the
          duration, cost, and comfort level of different vessels when choosing your transportation. Flights are limited
          and usually part of fly-cruise packages.
