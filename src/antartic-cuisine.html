                  kitchens. Meals are typically served buffet-style, featuring a variety of international dishes. Fresh
                  ingredients are flown in regularly, ensuring high-quality meals.

                  While Antarctic cuisine doesn't have traditional local dishes due to the continent's
                  lack of indigenous population, the focus is often on hearty, warming meals. You might find dishes
                  inspired by the regions travelers pass through en route, such as Patagonian lamb or Chilean seafood.

                  Cooking in Antarctica presents unique challenges due to the remote location and
                  extreme weather. Supply chains are long, and storage space on ships is limited, requiring careful menu
                  planning.

                  Modern expedition ships are equipped with advanced storage and cooking

                  and supplemented with preserved goods.
