                  Antarctica is home to several whale species, including humpback, blue, minke,
                  and orca whales. These giants migrate to Antarctic waters during the summer months to feed on krill
                  and small fish. Humpback whales are known for their acrobatic breaches and complex songs, while orcas,
                  or killer whales, display sophisticated hunting techniques.
